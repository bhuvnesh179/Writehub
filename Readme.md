- **Language**: TypeScript is used throughout the project to ensure type safety and improve code maintainability.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL is used as the primary database for storing all application data.
- **Serverless Backend**: The backend is deployed on Cloudflare, leveraging serverless architecture for scalability and cost efficiency.
- **ORM**: Prisma ORM is used for database interactions, providing a type-safe and intuitive API.
- **Validation**: Zod is used for schema validation, ensuring data integrity across both frontend and backend.

### Features
